# Handwritten-digit--Recognition
This project recognizes handwritten digits using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on the MNIST dataset. Users can upload an image of a digit, which is processed and predicted by the trained model. It combines image preprocessing, model prediction, and a simple interface for user interaction.
